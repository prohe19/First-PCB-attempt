# First-PCB-attempt
first keyboard project hopefully it'll be gooodddd

this is my first PCB design consists of only 4 MX ALP support Switches.
Also my first try of designing on Kicad, had some trouble on how to route those tracks
because apparently I really wanted it to be very aesthetic AF but here goes nothing!
anyways feel free to judge or to give some pointers on how things should be done!

Pros!
4 MX ALP support switches
pretty? maybe :D

Cons!
no LED support (still figuring out on how they made KBD PCB with RGB LED per key on Atmega 32U4!!
need to be preassembled, yes I designed this project to be preassembled because I am too lazy to solder those components its v small.
